## Overview

**Weddings in Motion** is a collection of visual stories captured across the islands of Hawaii — a celebration of movement, intimacy, and authenticity.  
Rather than staging moments, I seek to document the quiet gestures that define a couple’s connection: the way hands meet, eyes search, or laughter breaks between breaths.

This project represents my philosophy: that wedding photography should feel alive, cinematic, and deeply human.

## Approach

My approach is minimalist and intuitive.  
I rely on **natural light** and subtle direction, blending documentary storytelling with cinematic framing.  
Every wedding becomes an opportunity to merge elegance with emotion — crafting imagery that feels spontaneous yet timeless.

## Reflections

Weddings are more than events — they’re living narratives.  
I’ve learned that the most powerful frames come from **trust**, not direction.  
When people forget the camera, that’s when the story begins.
