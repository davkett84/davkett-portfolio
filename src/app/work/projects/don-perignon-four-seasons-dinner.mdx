## Overview

An intimate private dinner hosted by **Don Perignon** at the **Four Seasons Resort Ko Olina**, captured through a refined documentary lens.  
The event brought together fine dining, artful presentation, and emotional storytelling — blending elegance with intimacy in every frame.

My goal was to preserve the ambiance: reflections of candlelight on crystal glass, textures of champagne bubbles, and the spontaneous gestures of guests immersed in the moment.

## Approach

Working under low-light conditions, I focused on using available light and subtle composition to preserve the natural atmosphere.  
No flash, no interruptions — just observation and timing.  
Each frame was shot handheld to retain a cinematic, breathing quality, staying true to the visual rhythm of the evening.
