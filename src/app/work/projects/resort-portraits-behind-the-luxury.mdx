## Overview

**Resort Portraits** is an ongoing collection of images created across Hawaii’s leading destinations — including *Four Seasons Ko Olina*, *The Kahala Resort*, *Ritz-Carlton Turtle Bay*, and *Marriott’s Ko Olina Beach Club*.  
Each session reveals the quiet connection between people and place — from families reuniting under golden sunsets to staff preparing spaces that breathe calm and precision.

This series celebrates atmosphere and authenticity within curated environments, capturing real emotion within the elegance of resort life.

## Approach

I approach each resort as a living environment rather than a backdrop.  
The light, architecture, and guests all interact in their own rhythm — and my role is to listen visually.  
Every image is guided by intuition, timing, and respect for the moment.

I shoot handheld, often during transitional light — early mornings and dusk — to create warmth, depth, and natural emotion.

## Reflections

Working across these properties has refined my ability to find authenticity within luxury.  
Beyond architecture and beauty, it’s about presence — waiting for light to shape a story and people to forget the camera.
