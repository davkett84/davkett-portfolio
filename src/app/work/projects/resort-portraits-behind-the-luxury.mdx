## Overview

**Resort Stories** is an ongoing visual journal exploring the intersection between people, light, and place across Hawaii’s most iconic resorts — including *The Kahala*, *Four Seasons Ko Olina*, and *Marriott Ko Olina*.  
Each image captures quiet moments of connection: early-morning walks, families reuniting under sunset light, or couples framed by the ocean’s stillness.

This series celebrates natural light and atmosphere over perfection — a way to document real emotion in curated environments, turning everyday resort life into quiet, cinematic fragments.

## Approach

My approach is rooted in observation rather than direction.  
I shoot primarily during golden and blue hours, chasing reflections, silhouettes, and textures that communicate serenity.  
The emphasis is on emotion, composition, and honest light — using minimal gear to remain invisible to the moment.
