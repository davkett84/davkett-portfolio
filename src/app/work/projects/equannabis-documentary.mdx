## Overview

**Equannabis Documentary** tells the story of a company redefining sustainable agriculture in Ecuador.  
As **director, producer, and editor**, I was trusted by *Equannabis* and *Cáñamo Industrial Ecuador* to craft a film that captures the company’s beginnings — from the first harvests of industrial hemp to their vision of natural wellness and social innovation.  

The film documents the emergence of a new industry built on transparency, research, and respect for the environment.  
Through natural light and quiet composition, it reveals how Equannabis is cultivating more than crops — it’s cultivating change.

## Approach

My approach was grounded in authenticity and restraint.  
Using **handheld camera movement**, natural light, and subtle pacing, I aimed to reflect the company’s philosophy: innovation rooted in nature.  
The project was shot in Ecuador’s coastal and highland regions, highlighting the synergy between science, sustainability, and human effort.

## Reflections

This project marked a pivotal collaboration — one where storytelling and sustainability intersected.  
Documenting Equannabis was more than a production; it was an opportunity to witness how vision and persistence can spark an entire industry.  

The documentary reflects both the humility of beginnings and the ambition of what’s to come.
